# Food Order Analysis using Sql
 The Food Order Analysis project is aimed at exploring and analyzing food order data to gain valuable insights into customer preferences, order patterns, and restaurant performance. By leveraging SQL, this project will allow us to manipulate, aggregate, and visualize data from various sources to answer critical questions and make data-driven decisions in the food industry.


Project Overview
 This project utilizes the Zomato dataset to analyze food orders, customer preferences, and restaurant performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve restaurant businesses and enhance customer satisfaction.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In this project, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis. Below are the key steps taken:

Removing Unwanted Columns:
      Identified and removed columns that were not relevant to our analysis. These columns included [list the column names you removed].

Renaming Columns:
      Renamed columns to make them more descriptive and consistent. This step improved the readability of the dataset and made it easier to work with.

Handling Null Values:
     Checked for missing values (null or NaN) in the dataset.
     Replaced null values with appropriate values or used imputation techniques where necessary.
     Ensured that all columns had valid and complete data.

Creating a Cleaned Dataset:
      After performing the above steps, we created a cleaned dataset with a consistent structure, relevant columns, and no missing values.
      This cleaned dataset served as the foundation for our subsequent data analysis.
      The data cleaning process was essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis results. The cleaned dataset was used for all further data exploration and analysis tasks.
 
 Data Analysis
In this phase of the project, we utilized SQL queries to extract insights and answer critical questions about the food order dataset. Our analysis focused on various aspects of the data, including customer preferences, order patterns, and restaurant performance

Technologies Used
SQL for data querying and manipulation.
SQL databases for data storage.
Python for data preprocessing and Cleaning.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in the food industry. By leveraging the Zomato dataset and SQL, it provides valuable insights to improve restaurant businesses, enhance customer experiences, and drive profitability.
